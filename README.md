e::Graph
--------

A minimalistic [e-graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-graph) implementation in C++, inspired by [Metatheory.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Metatheory.jl) and [egg](https://egraphs-good.github.io).

This is a WIP pet project, which aims for simplicity and readability, and is developed for the purposes of self-education and testing random ideas, so probably do not use it in production.
