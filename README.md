e::Graph
--------

A naive [e-graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-graph) implementation in pidgin C++, inspired by [Metatheory.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Metatheory.jl) and [egg](https://egraphs-good.github.io).

Aims for simplicity, readability and hackability. Developed for the purposes of self-education and testing random ideas, probably do not use it in production.
